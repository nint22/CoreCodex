[challenge]
title: Power Plant Simulation
difficulty: 1
language: python
points: 5

[description]
shortdesc: Simulate a powerplant's activities, recording statistical data.
longdesc:
	A powerplant for the city of Redmond goes offline every third day because of local demands. Ontop
	of this, the powerplant has to go offline for maintence every 100 days. Keeping things complicated,
	every 10th day the powerplant is turned off for refuiling the power-rods.
	
input:
	i - The integer to convert into the given base-n
	n - The base in which to convert the decimal i into
output:
	Print i in base-n notation

[code]
starter:
	|def basen_convert(n):
	|	print "0"

[sample]
code:
	basen_convert(123, 8)
	basen_convert(123, 10)
	basen_convert(123, 36)

input:
output:
	81
	25

[test]
code:
	basen_convert(123, 8)
	basen_convert(123, 10)
