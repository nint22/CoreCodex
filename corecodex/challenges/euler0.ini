difficulty: 2
language: python
points: 10

[description]
shortdesc: Return the sum of multiples between a range of digits.
longdesc:
	<p>If we list all the numbers from 1 to 10, only the numbers 3, 5, 6, 9, 10 are multiples
	of 3 and 5. Your goal is to write a function that, given a range of numbers, you must
	return the sum of all numbers that are multples of 3 and 5.</p>

input:
	<p>range_start - The starting range of the number list</p>
	<p>range_end - The ending range of the number list</p>

output:
	<p>Print the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 within the given range (inclusively)</p>

[code]
starter:
	|def sum(range_start, range_end):
	|	print "0"

[sample]
code:
	sum(1, 10)
	sum(100, 200)

input:
output:
	33
	7050

[test]
code:
	sum(1, 10)
