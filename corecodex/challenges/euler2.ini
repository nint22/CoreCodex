[description]
shortdesc: Return a list of prime factors of a given integer.
longdesc:
	<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_factor">Prime factors</a> are the prime numbers that can evenly divide a given integer. For example,
	the prime factors of the integer 21 are 7 and 3, because both 7 and 3 are prime and they divide into 21 evenly (producing no remainder).
	To complete this challenge, you must find all prime factors for a given integer and return an array.</p>
	
input:
	<p>n - The integer in which you must find all prime factors for</p>

output:
	<p>Return the list of prime factors (in ascending order)</p>

starter:
	|def prime_factors(n):
	|	return [1, 2, 3]

[sample]
code:
	prime_factors(21)

input:
output:
	[3, 7]
	[2, 5]

[test]
code:
	prime_factors(21)
	prime_factors(100)
	prime_factors(0)
	prime_factors(999)

input:
output:
	[3, 7]
	[2, 5]
	[]
	[3, 37]
