[description]
shortdesc: Given a range of numbers, check for dating compatibility.
longdesc:
	You are to write a function that checks if two persons are "compatable" to date. Each person has
	a pair of numbers a and b which represents a compatibility range (a "love" unit, or simply "lunit").
	It is true for each person that their range values will always be 0 &le; a &le; b &le; 100.
	
	You are to find the overlap between these two ranges for the two persons and return True if the
	overlap is equal to or over 25 "lunits". Return false otherwise.

input:
	candidate_a_start - Person a's starting range value
	candidate_a_end - Person a's starting range value
	candidate_b_start - Person b's ending range value
	candidate_b_end - Person b's ending range value
output:
	Return true

[code]
starter:
	|def check_match(candidate_a_start, candidate_a_end, candidate_b_start, candidate_b_end):
	|	return True

[sample]
code:
	print check_match(1, 50, 40, 70)
	print check_match(1, 75, 50, 75)

input:
output:
	False
	True

	print check_match(1, 75, 50, 75)
