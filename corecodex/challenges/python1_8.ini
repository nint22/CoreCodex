title: Decimal to base-n
difficulty: 1
language: python
points: 5

[description]
shortdesc: Given an integer, print it into a base-n number system.
longdesc:
	Given an integer i, print its base-n (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix">
	hexadecimal</a>) form. This integer i will always be positive. The base-n value will be bound
	between 2 &le; n &le; 36. The symbols needed to represent this base-n value are to be the
	symbols 0-9 and a-z, 36 characters in all. For example, if you were to be converting i into
	a base-10 number, you would be expected to use the characters 0-9. If you were to convert to a base-16
	number, you would be expected to use the characters 0-9 and a-f.
	
input:
	i - The integer to convert into the given base-n
	n - The base in which to convert the decimal i into
output:
	Print i in base-n notation
