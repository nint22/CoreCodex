[description]
shortdesc: Check if an engine should be turned on or off based on sensor values.
longdesc:
	Write a function that returns True or False if an engine should be turned on or off based on
	sensor values. This function must take two sensor readings: the engine block tempurature and
	the oil reserve. If the engine block tempurature is ever above 100 degrees, return false (off).
	If the oil is low and the engine block is above 80, return false (off). The oil reserve is an
	integer ranging from 0 to 2 (inclusive). 0 means an empty, in which your function should return
	false (off). 1 means low oil, while 2 means standard oil volume. In any other condition, return true
	(on) for the engine state.
	
input:
	temp - The engine block tempurature
	oil - The oil volume, encoded between 0 and 1
output:
	Return True or False based on if the engine should be on or off, respectively

[code]
starter:
	|def check_engine(temp, oil):
	|	return True # Turn engine "on"

[sample]
code:
	check_engine(105, 2)
	check_engine(77, 2)
	check_engine(60, 0)

input:
output:
	False
	True
	False

[test]
code:
	check_engine(105, 2)
	check_engine(77, 2)
	check_engine(60, 0)
input:
output:
	False
	True
	False
