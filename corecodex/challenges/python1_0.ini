	You are to write a function that prints out one of three possible strings based on the day
	of the week and if you are doing overtime for your day-job. If the given day is a weekday (i.e.
	Monday through Friday), you are to print "No party today". If the given day is a weekend and you
	are not working overtime, then you are to print "Party today!". Else, if the given day is a weekend
	and you are working overtime, then you are to print "Can't party".
	
	Weekdays are given to you encoded as an integer, ranging from 1 to 7. 1 is Monday, 2 is Tuesday, ...,
	7 is Sunday. Overtime is encoded as a boolean, where true represents you are working overtime and
	false otherwise.
